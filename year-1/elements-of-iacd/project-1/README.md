# Unequal Length Mazes â€“ Heuristic Search for Solitaire Games

## Project Description
This project implements and solves a **solitaire game** called **Unequal Length Mazes**.  
The program is capable of:  
- Allowing a **human player** to play the game in **Normal Mode** or **Challenge Mode**.  
- Solving different levels automatically using the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm.  

The program evaluates the solution based on:  
- Whether the player reaches the goal cell (top-right) after visiting all other cells.  
- Compliance with the game rules (no revisiting cells, no crossing obstacles, segments in different directions not having the same length).  
- Ability to move through all reachable cells without getting blocked. 

The interface shows the evolution of the board, allowing user interaction and optionally providing hints.
