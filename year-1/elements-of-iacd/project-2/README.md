# Data exploration and enrichment for supervised classification

## Project Description
This project develops a **full data science pipeline** for supervised classification using the **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) dataset**, collected at Coimbra Hospital and University Center (CHUC), Portugal.  

The pipeline includes:
- **Data Exploration:** Examine feature types, record counts, class distribution, missing values, outliers, irrelevant features, etc., supported with visualizations.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Imputation of missing values, feature scaling, data transformation, feature engineering, and removal of redundant features. 
- **Data Modeling:** Building classification models (Decision Trees and KNN) to predict 1-year survivability (“lives” or “dies”). Additional classifiers were optional.  
- **Evaluation:** Compare models using metrics such as confusion matrix, ROC/AUC, precision, recall, accuracy. Visualizations are provided with Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- **Interpretation:** Extract meaningful insights, explain model behavior, discuss preprocessing effects, and provide recommendations for future analysis.
