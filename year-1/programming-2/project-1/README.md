# Project 1 - Programming 2

## Theme
Text and DNA sequence analysis using Python for data processing, exploration, and biological information analysis.

## Brief Description
This project consists of two parts:

1. **Part 1 - Text Processing**  
   - Reading and organizing paragraphs from text files.
   - Identification and analysis of chapters.
   - Determining the shortest chapter, the longest dialogue, and mentions of specific characters.
   - Extraction of monologues addressed to a given character.

2. **Part 2 - DNA Sequence Analysis**  
   - Reading and processing DNA sequences from FASTA files.
   - Determining complementary and reverse strands.
   - Identification of proteins encoded in the sequences (ORFs).
   - Extraction of intergenic regions.
