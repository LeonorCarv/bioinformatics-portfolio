# Project 3

## Theme
Visualization and analysis of fractal systems, environmental data, geospatial listings, and ecological networks using Python for exploration and insight extraction.

## Brief Description
This project demonstrates the processing and visualization of diverse datasets using Python, including:

1. **Part 1 - L-Systems and Fractals**: Generation and visualization of plant-like structures using recursive string rewriting (L-Systems) and turtle graphics.

2. **Part 2 - Environmental Data**: Analysis and interactive visualization of European Union recycling data (packaging and municipal waste) using Matplotlib widgets.

3. **Part 3 - Geospatial Data Analysis**: Mapping Airbnb listings and neighborhood reviews in Porto, Portugal, using GeoPandas and Contextily for basemaps.

4. **Part 4 - Ecosystem Networks**: Construction and visualization of a trophic network, representing biomass transfer between species using NetworkX.
