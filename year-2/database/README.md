# Database Project – SQLite

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to explore and manage a given database using **SQLite**.  
The tasks included:
- Designing the **UML diagram** and the **Relational Model** of the database.  
- Populating the database with sample data.  
- Creating multiple **SQL queries** to answer useful domain-related questions.  
- Developing a **Python + Flask interface** to interact with the database through a web browser.  

This way, the project combined theoretical aspects (modeling) with practical database querying and application development.

## Learning Goals
- Understand relational database modeling (UML → Relational Model).  
- Learn how to populate and query databases using SQLite.  
- Implement SQL queries for real-world questions.  
- Develop a simple web interface in **Python + Flask** to interact with the data. 


## Requirements
Make sure you have **Python 3** and **SQLite3** installed. Then install Flask, either with pip or conda:
- Using pip:
```bash
pip install flask
- Using conda: conda install flask


## How to Run
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project root directory.
2. Start the Flask server with: python3 app.py
3. Once the server starts, you will see a message indicating it is running at: http://127.0.0.1:5000
4. Copy this link and open it in your browser to interact with the database.
